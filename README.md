### Hello World! 

I'm Thomas üòÅ,

I like tech, music, & video games. I mainly program in Go and I love checking out other technologies such as UE4, Blender, Zig, etc.

Some things you should know about me:

 - I like to create and use my own libraries (I do not enjoy being locked into existing frameworks).
 - I think JavaScript is very cool but ruined by lack of type definitions & the web ecosystem. I will not touch Node with a 10 foot pole.
 - It's my opinion that the HTTP is stoopid and has done more harm to app development than good.
 - I'd love to make a video game! üéÆ
 - I'm open to any career opportunities that involve building better technologies for the progression of human kind!
 - I'm currently working on "leet" productivity tools.
 - I'm a big fan of Linux, Windows, and iOS.
 - My daily driver is a Lenovo P53 Thinkpad running Windows 10 with Debian WSL with an iPhone 11 on the side!
 - I'm big believer of simplicity.

You can reach me at my email in the sidebar!
