### Hello World! 

I'm Thomas 😁,

I like tech, music, & video games. I mainly program in Go and I love checking out other technologies such as UE4, Blender, Zig, etc.

I'm open to opportunities that involve working on making this earth a better place or video games. Hit me up if you have an interesting project!

My email is in the sidebar.
